<p>Abstract: In this document, we look into a 6th grader with an IEP for reading comprehension, and how we can help them in a math classroom based on observation in multiple classrooms, their IEP file, and two articles about reading in the math classroom. This student had trouble with organization and reading skills, until their parents became involved more with their teachers and then the student improved in their work. Using graphic organizers and other chunking methods will help students with reading comprehension with vocabulary and other reading skills. Especially in math class, it is important for students to read and comprehend, and I will state how I will use the strategies I observed and read to help students with reading comprehension problems in my future classroom, such as graphic organizers, text relatability, and parental contact. </p>
<h3 align="center">InTASC 1 Reflection</h3>
<p>The student I chose for this assignment is a 6th grader, new to the middle school. Student A has an IEP for reading accommodations, meaning they are in a remedial reading class, and their teachers must adapt for their reading ability in ways such as chunking text, reading aloud to them when asked, and text-to-speech during PARCC and other standardized tests. The primary disability stated on their IEP is “other health impairment” meaning it could be anything that is not labeled as a learning disability, such as ADHD. </p>
<p>While in core classes the student is easily distracted, in elective courses they are incredibly focused and well behaved, because they enjoy being in those classes. The student also enjoys sports, as they play many types such as soccer and baseball. This is a fantastic topic for them to relate to school content. Student A’s parents are highly involved in their school life, with constant communication with their teachers and checking up on them consistently. The student’s parents emailed the teachers about the student being overwhelmed with school work, which concerned them. With email interaction, Student A’s parents and teachers worked together to restate student resources and provide consistent care. </p>
<p>On the first day in school with students, my mentor teacher instructed me to help Student A organize their papers and binder on their desk and catch them up from missed instruction because they missed the first few minutes of class. In class that day the students made a manipulative, so I also helped Student A with the creation and we got along well. Every day I am in school I try to say hello and ask how their previous class time was. During most classes I proactively help Student A either catch up on instruction , organize or I am instructed to do so. Student A has gotten exponentially better in their organization and attention skills after their parents got more involved in their school work. </p>
<p>Their behavior in middle school is backed by their grades from elementary school, where they got all A’s in their non-core classes and Bs and Cs in core courses. When Student As parents emailed their teachers and guidance counselor, they stated that Student A had never felt so overwhelmed with schoolwork as they did at that moment. The only observational evidence that Student As felt frustrated was when they could not see the projector screen properly because the teacher was blocking it. That one moment was the only indication that Student A got frustrated and stressed about their work. In class, Student A is easily distracted by peers, fidgets frequently, and needs repeated instruction for various reasons. These reason s include not paying attention, or forgetting the original announcement. In relation to their IEP, my mentor teacher (for math) does a lot of chunking and steps for reading in her classroom, and if Student A needs help reading she or I will gladly clarify it. </p>
<p>In my research articles, I read about different strategies to use in the math classroom that have to do with reading and vocabulary. It is imperative that teachers make sure students can “speak mathematically”, meaning that they use the vocab when possible. These strategies include the Frayer Model, used much in reading classes for vocabulary words; the Four Square organizer, which is similar to the Frayer Model. However this graphic organizer has a block for a “lightbulb word” where students can choose a word to help them individually remind themselves of the vocab. Feature Analysis is a strategy where students use a table or graphic organizer to compare and contrast different vocabulary in order to find patterns; Making Predictions is wonderful for students to think deeper about what could come next in a situation and justify that reasoning; Monitoring Comprehension allows students to think to themselves about their own comprehension and understand why they are having trouble; Determining Importance in texts is much like finding the “main idea”, using key words and graphic organizers; and Making Connections, which relates content to something in the students’ lives, such as the many sports Student A plays. Relating mathematics content to basketball, baseball, soccer, football, or any other sport will help students become more interested and engaged in math and reading. </p>
<p>For Student A in particular, I observed during their Chorus class that when the teacher related something to sports, Student A got incredibly excited and interested. Therefore classroom practices that will help Student A include relating problems to sports, which they are incredibly interested in; checking up on their comprehension, and encouraging Student A to also self-check; and chunking of material so they do not get frustrated and overwhelmed. The teachers at Ridgely Middle School are not supposed to allow students to just play around on their devices, but giving Student A game breaks at the end of a class period when there is no more content to cover would also be beneficial, especially if the game is on BCPSOne and educational. There are plenty of games on the internet that are engaging and educational, and this would provide a break from sitting and listening to a teacher and instead further their education in a way that they love. </p>
<p>In the future, I will be constantly chunking material so that the students in my classroom do not get overwhelmed by the amount of content thrown at them. This will also be supplemented by graphic organizers, manipulatives, and activities that get students up and out of their seats. I also will work hard to make the content problems relatable to student lives, even perhaps making up word problems on the fly in front of students about them that particular day. I also absolutely love the idea of using the Four Square organizer because of the “lightbulb word”, especially for students who have trouble with vocabulary. I will also make consistent contact with parents, calling and/or emailing them about their student; checking up on them, complementing the student if possible, and other things. This is an incredibly important aspect of the type of teacher I wish to be: one that visibly shows I care about the students, parents, and community. Observing Student A has helped me grow as a teacher and I hope to continue to learn from them. </p>

<h3 align="center">Notes and Observations</h3>
<h4>9.8.2017 (Mentor Teacher Classroom Notes 1)</h4>
<u1>
	<li>Student sits in the back, held the door for other students in the morning (was one of the first students to arrive to class)</li>
	<li>Has an upbeat attitude</li>
	<li>Today in class we did a SOLVE foldable: Student started the foldable late because they accidentally got glue on the desk and had to clean it up using a Clorox wipe. They cleaned the whole desk instead of just the glued area. They did catch up with the foldable, but at the end of the period the students were about to finish they started to get slightly frustrated because they couldn’t see the board. The student insisted on using different color markers for the entire foldable, even if it made them lose focus and get behind.</li>
	<li>Binder was very organized (as the teacher has her students do).</li>
	<li>At the beginning of class they got distracted and then was behind in copying homework and the teacher recommended that I go next to them and remind them what he needed to do, even if it was just a couple of things.</li>
	<li>At the end of the period the teacher asked if I would help them in all the classes I was present because they needs the extra accommodation (not because of IEP or 504).</li>
</u1>
<p>Later in the day we had a fire drill and the student volunteered to hold the laminated paper to let administration know all the students were present. During that time at one point they loudly said “bandwagon” to no one in particular; they said it twice more loudly and then softer again to no one. For the rest of the fire drill they listened to instruction and was quiet per the directions of the teacher. </p>
<h4>9.18.2017 (Mentor Teacher Classroom Notes 2)</h4>
<u2>
	<li>Teacher put student in charge of turning lights on and off per her request (good for getting him out of their seat and moving so they are more likely to pay attention</li>
	<li>Student was good today behaviorwise; was obedient: copied homework into agenda when told, checked homework with the class, did group work and checked group work with class.</li>
	<li>I found out on Friday that they have an IEP, and last week parents got involved and since then they have been much better with organization, missing work, etc.</li>
	<li>Took chair out of door at beginning of class and back to the seat it was supposed to be at</li>
	<li>Today they seemed much better organized than last week, binder looked good, knew agenda was in the bag with device.</li>
</u2>
<h4>9.11.2017 (Art Classroom)</h4>
<u3>
	<li>Went to Chorus class to observe student</li>
	<li>Student is constantly moving or fidgeting with the seat, kicking the seat in front of them, tapping, etc. but they also seems to always be paying attention unless they are talking to another student across the room; sat down when they weren’t supposed to sometimes.</li>
	<li>Yells out constantly, loudly: Example “Yea (student A)’s book you’re better than (student A)” </li>
	<li>Teacher looked in their direction multiple times during the class and that almost always immediately got them to be quiet. </li>
	<li>Yelled out to the teacher when the teacher made a comment about sports: they like the class and wants the teacher to get to know them better</li>
	<li>At the end of class the teacher kept the students for a few seconds after the bell rings, but student tried to dash out the door (did not succeed)</li>
	<li>Responded well to instruction</li>
	<p><li>Things student has to do in math but not chorus: <u4>
		<li>Read (so far)</li>
		<li>Write</li>
		<li>Deep thinking</li>
		<li>Use technology</li></li>
</u4></u3></p>
<h4>9.22.2017 (Reading Class)</h4>
<u5>
	<li>Background: The reading class is a remedial class in itself with students who are below the 6th grade reading level only. Everyone else is put into English LA. 
The student asked the teacher to go somewhere before class started and therefore was late to instruction. The lesson for the day was an IReady Diagnostic test to see what they knew. The teacher gave instruction on the test while the student was gone, so they just sat there until prompted to do something “Do you know what to do?” When another student told the teacher that student would catch Student A up. A little while into the class, the student asked the teacher to go get a drink and she was distracted while they were talking to her: Thus when she instructed to wait for a bathroom pass (there was another child using it) they talked back to her. Not rudely, because it was clarification that they were getting a drink not going to the bathroom. </li>
	<li>The test was taken on their computers and the students were instructed to use headphones if they had them. The student did not. Unsure if students were directed at an earlier time to bring headphones or not. </li>
	<p><li>Facial expressions of the student during the test:<u6><p>
		<li>Focused (most of the time), very blank</li>
		<li>Daunted</li>
		<li>Confused</li>
</u6></p>
	<li>Talked to another student for some of the test time, perhaps for clarification questions; I notice that the student during this test is easily distracted by movement, other students talking to the teacher, etc. </li>
	<li>When the teacher announced the amount of minutes left, the student called out about instruction that he missed. They were already told these instructions by the teacher at an earlier time. The teacher ignored or didn’t hear, and after a few seconds they gave up on an answer. </li>
	<li>When the students were told to stop the test, she allowed them to play games or something on their device. When this happened, the student got very quiet and concentrated on his game, and did not get distracted by anything until told to pack up for the end of the day (put up chairs and things like that)</li>
	<li>Another thing I noticed at the end of class was that the student and the teacher banter with each other; this says they are on good terms.</li>
